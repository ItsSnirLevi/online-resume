        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Passionate and dedicated second-year computer science student with a strong foundation in coding
             and a proven track record of academic excellence. Currently enrolled in the honors program 
             at Afeka College – SmartUp, I received the first-year Computer Science Honor Student Award for 
             my outstanding achievements.
            <br /><br />
            I am a quick learner with a strong passion for coding and problem-solving. 
             As a commander in the IDF, I gained experience 
            teaching code and explaining various concepts to students, sharpening my communication skills.
            <br /><br />
            A strong team player, I thrive in collaborative environments, valuing colleagues' 
            expertise. I have a constant thirst for knowledge and absorb insights from my peers. 
            I am seeking internships, part-time jobs, research collaborations, or projects in which I 
            can contribute my expertise, learn from colleagues, and grow both personally and professionally.
            <br /><br />Know my way around Java, C#, C, Python, Java Script, html and the Unity engine.
